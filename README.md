# Java_web_browser

 a simple web browser
 
 
  It contains an address bar where a user can type the address and a go button which when clicked loads the web page. For displaying the web pages we require JEditor Pane and HyperlinkListener is required to respond when the user clicks on a link in the document. 
 The search history is contained (also used to go back and forward )in an array which can be done better by using a db storge.
